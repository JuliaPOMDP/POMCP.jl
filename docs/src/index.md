## Installation

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/sisl/POMCP.jl.git")
```

## Documentation

This implementation of the POMCP solver may be used to solve POMDPs defined according to the [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/sisl/POMDPs.jl) interface. Note that this is an online solver, so the computation is carried out as the simulation is running (simulations take a long time, but `solve` takes no time).

For a usage example, see the [Basic Usage](https://github.com/sisl/POMCP.jl/blob/master/notebooks/Basic%20Usage.ipynb) notebook. For some more (poorly documented) examples, see the [Sanity Checks](https://github.com/sisl/POMCP.jl/blob/master/notebooks/Sanity%20Checks.ipynb) notebook.

Behavior is controlled through two mechanisms: solver options and method specializations.

There is also an interactive search tree visualizer

## Tree Visualization

Rudimentary interactive visualization of the MCTS tree is available in python notebooks (improving this visualization is something I'd love help on). Run the Display Tree notebook in the notebooks folder for a demo (it doesn't show up in the version of the notebook on github).
